# Using the Admin Interface

Note: If the cart is flipped into manual mode from a human, to resume autonoumous driving, flip it back into autonomous mode, go into the local-admin screen, and toggle the "Pullover" switch.  It will then toggle ROS to resend the last command.

# Deploying and using local-admin interface

Clone Repository into catkin_ws/src directory

Navigate into the local-admin directory

Run the command npm i.

Run the command 'npm run linux-start'.  The GUI should appear.

At the top, click the "Config" button.  Enter in the paths to the other resources.  These can be relative or absolute.

Then enter in the ports that each server should use.

Click "Start All Servers".  Another terminal tab should now appear. Enter in the sudo password to launch ros.

Wait for ros to start up, then click the "Reload UI" button.  The page should now appear in the web browser ready to navigate.



*Note, if you kill ROS, please use the ./run.sh file to re-launch it.  You will need to reload the UI again using the 'Reload UI' button once ROS is back up.*

# Getting Started with Create React App

# Install Node 14.16.0 using nvm!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
